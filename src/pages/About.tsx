        <h1>A small studio that cares about the details.</h1>
        <p className="lead">
          Acme Ltd was founded in 2014 with a simple idea: independent
          businesses deserve the same quality of design as the big brands,
          without the six-figure retainer.

          <h2>Our story</h2>
          <p>
            We started in a shared workspace above a bakery in Portland, Maine,
            building websites for the shop owners we knew personally. Word
            spread, and twelve years later we've worked with restaurants,
            boutiques, nonprofits, and contractors across New England, but the
            approach hasn't changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every project starts with a conversation about your customers, not
            a template picker. We design around how people actually find and
            use your site, then build it to be fast, easy to update, and
            genuinely yours.
